        %h2.section_title What is PicketLink ?
        %p
          PicketLink is an open source project for simplified security and identity
          management for Java Applications. 
        %br
        %br
        %h2.section_title Why the name "PicketLink" ?
        %p
          A Picket Fence is a secure system of pickets joined together
          via some type of links. Basically, the Pickets by themselves do
          not offer any security. But when they are brought together by
          linking them, they provide the necessary security.
        %p
          This project is that link for other security systems or
          systems to bring together or join, to finally provide the
          necessary secure system.

          %h5 Arquillian
          %p
            From the very start, PicketLink has been designed with
            testability in mind. The secret to that fidelity is
            %a{:href => "http://www.arquillian.org"} Arquillian
            a component
            model for integration tests that execute inside the real runtime
            environment.
        .span6
          %h5 Smarter Development
          %p
            Using Arquillian for development gives you an extremely
            fast change, compile, test cycle for any component model. This
            strategy allows you to take Test Driven Development (TDD) further
            than ever before.
