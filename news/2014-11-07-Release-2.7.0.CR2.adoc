We're very pleased to announce PicketLink v2.7.0.CR2 release.

The most significant changes included in this version are related with:

* Improvements to PicketLink IDM Query API
* Improvements to SAML Metadata, Encryption and Attributes Support
* The SAML Service Provider Servlet Filter was updated

The PicketLink Query API is now more flexible and supports different type of conditions when querying your identity types. The documentation
was updated to reflect these changes. Some methods were marked as deprecated, but changes do not impact backward compatibility.
